# Practicum_project_12 (Final)
 My twelfth project from Practicum course

The final project includes 3 parts: A/B testing, SQL assignments and Product range project.

Description for each part is written in a file of the same name:

1) AB_test_part.ipynb

My predecessors failed to complete it: they launched an A/B test and then quit. They left only the technical specifications and the test results. I need to explore the data, carry out exploratory data analysis, evaluate the A/B test results and make some conclusions regarding the EDA stage and the A/B test results.

2) SQL_part.ipynb

I've been given a database of one of the services competing in book market. My task is to find the answer to 5 questions posed using only SQL queries via Python. (connection via sqlalchemy was used, which is only possible through the training platform through login/password)

3) Product range part.ipynb

Task here: to analyze the table with orders and identify popular and unpopular products. Based on this analysis, identify patterns, knowledge of which will help increase the number of sales. 

Analysis includes:

-data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis
-categorization the products using the lemmatization method
-RFM analysis
-"Basket Analysis" using the "Apriori method"
-hypothesis testing using statistical methods
